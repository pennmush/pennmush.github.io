<p>PennMUSH is a freely available MUD-style server that provides a form of textual virtual reality. It maintains a persistent world database containing players, objects, rooms, exits, and programs. People connect to the server and take on characters in the virtual world, interacting with other players from around the (real) world. Common activities include game playing, role-playing, socializing, world-building, etc. These servers have also been used for education, research, and artistic endeavors.</p>

<p>Want to try it out? You can use a <a href="http://client.pennmush.org/guest/m.u.s.h">browser-based client to connect to a game called M*U*S*H</a> without installing any software. We're friendly, stop in and say hi!</p>

<p>PennMUSH has an active team of developers/maintainers, and has been under continuous improvement since its first release in 1992!</p>

<p>PennMUSH runs on almost any UNIX derivative, including Linux and OS X, as well as Windows. You can <a href="http://www.github.com/pennmush/pennmush">find the source code on GitHub</a>, along with <a href="https://github.com/pennmush/pennmush/blob/master/INSTALL">installation instructions</a>.</p>

<p>If you don't have a server to run PennMUSH on, or don't know how to compile programs from source code, there are several commercial services that can help you. Stop by M*U*S*H (see below) and ask for advice.</p>
