<p>PennMUSH is a freely available MUD-style server that provides a
form of textual virtual reality. It maintains a persistent world
database containing players, objects, rooms, exits, and
programs. People connect to the server and take on characters in the
virtual world, interacting with other players from around the (real)
world. Common activities include game playing, role-playing,
socializing, world-building, etc. These servers have also been used
for education, research, and artistic endeavors.</p>

<p>Want to try it out? You can use
a <a href="http://client.pennmush.org/guest/m.u.s.h">browser-based
client to connect to a game
called <a href="http://mush.pennmush.org">M*U*S*H</a></a> without
installing any software. We're friendly, stop in and say hi!</p>

<p>PennMUSH has an active team of developers/maintainers, and has been
under continuous improvement since its first release in 1992! The
current reelase is 1.8.7p0 made on August 10, 2018.</p>

<p>PennMUSH runs on almost any UNIX derivative, including Linux and OS
X, as well as Windows. You
can <a href="https://www.github.com/pennmush/pennmush">find the source
code on GitHub</a>,
or <a href="https://download.pennmush.org/Source/">download a specific
release</a>. Once you have a copy of the files, follow
the <a href="docs/INSTALL.html">installation instructions</a>.</p>

<p>If you don't have a server to run PennMUSH on, or don't know how to
compile programs from source code, there are several commercial
services that can help you. Stop by M*U*S*H (see below) and ask for
advice.</p>
