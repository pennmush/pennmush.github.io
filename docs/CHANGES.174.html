 <ul>
  <li>Win32 portability fixes. <b>[EEH]</b></li>
  <li>grep for &#39;grep&#39; rather than &#39;egrep&#39; in restart because in grep 2.5.1, egrep is a shell script that exec&#39;s grep instead of a link. Fix by Vadiv<code>@M</code>*U*S*H.</li>

  <li>Help for <code>following()</code> function added. Report by Ashen-Shugar<code>@Rhost</code>.</li>
  <li>The last line of the access.cnf file sometimes wouldn&#39;t get read  properly. <b>[SW]</b></li>
  <li>lnum improperly cached its return values without consideration for changes in separator, so subsequent lnums with different separators broke. Reported by <em>Rhysem and Ambrosia<code>@M</code>*U*S*H</em>. <b>[TAP]</b></li>

 </ul>

<h3>Fixes</h3>

 <ul>
  <li>Improved help for <code>edit()</code>. Suggested by <em>Trispis<code>@M</code>*U*S*H <b>[SW]</b></em></li>
  <li>List functions with null elements and a null output seperator could trip end-of-buffer checks and stop in the middle of a list. <b>[SW]</b></li>

  <li>Messages associated with drop, give, and get are now more verbose and provide more information about who did what to whom. Suggested by <em>Philip Mak</em>.</li>

  <li>QUEUE and sempahore attributes are now removed (not just emptied) when drained or notified to 0. <b>[TAP]</b></li>
 </ul>

<h3>Fixes</h3>

  <li>A significant bug in the manual notification of timed semaphores has  been corrected. <b>[SW]</b></li>
  <li>Revian<code>@M</code>*U*S*H pointed out that user-defined commands starting with &quot;@&quot; that match the names of standard attributes don&#39;t behave as you might expect. This is now documented in help user-defined commands.</li>

  <li>help <code>set()</code> improved based on report by Tareldin<code>@M</code>*U*S*H.</li>
  <li><code>folderstats()</code> did not behave as promised in the help. Now it does. Report by Trispis<code>@M</code>*U*S*H.</li>

  <li>MacOS portability fixes. <b>[DW]</b></li>
  <li>The sigusr1 handler would reinstall itself as the sighup handler on systems that don&#39;t provide persistent signals.  Fixed by Bellemore<code>@M</code>*U*S*H.</li>
  <li>&amp;a=b me now properly clears the attribute A=B. Reported by <em> Trispis<code>@M</code>*U*S*H</em>. In addition, now <code>@tel</code> #1234= produces an error, as it should. <b>[SW]</b></li>
  <li>mail functions can now be called by an object on anything it controls (typically, its owner). Suggested by <em>Trispis<code>@M</code>*U*S*H</em>.</li>
  <li>The givee is now correctly passed in <var>%1</var> to <code>@give/</code><code>@ogive/</code><code>@agive</code>, and documented. Reported by <em>Philip Mak</em>.</li>

<h2>Version 1.7.4 patchlevel 15 (February 8, 2002)</h2>

<h3>Minor Changes</h3>

 <ul>
  <li><code>@dolist</code> and <code>iter()</code>, where multiple tokens are replaced (## and #@), now do both replacements at once. This is more efficient in several ways and fixes a problem where if the second token gets into the string from a replacement of the first, it gets replaced. (iter(a#@, ##) should return a#@, not a1). <b>[SW]</b></li>
  <li>setunion no longer eats empty list elements. <b>[SW]</b></li>
  <li>The help text for <code>items()</code> is now more descriptive of how it works and differs from <code>words()</code>. Suggested by <em>Zen<code>@SW1</code></em>.</li>
  <li>When you attempt to <code>@chzone</code> an object to a ZMO without a zone-lock, a default zone-lock of &quot;owner of the ZMO&quot; is now set, and the attempt succeeds. Suggested by <em>Linda Antonsson</em>.</li>
  <li>In the French message translation files, the word &#39;drapeau&#39; and &#39;flag&#39; were used interchangeably. I&#39;ve standardized on &#39;flag&#39;. Report by Vexon<code>@M</code>*U*S*H.</li>
 </ul>

<h3>Fixes</h3>

 <ul>
  <li>Message typo fixed by Bellemore<code>@M</code>*U*S*H.</li>
  <li>No more ansified names in logged shutdown messages. Report by Bellemore<code>@M</code>*U*S*H.</li>
  <li>Messages when destroying players now take into account the  destroy_possessions and really_safe settings. Suggested by <em>Wayne<code>@PDX</code></em>.</li>
  <li>The parser no longer strips any first layer of braces in, e.g. <code>@switch</code> action clauses, but only when the first character in the clause is a brace. This prevents <code>@sw</code> 1=1, <code>@wait</code> me={<code>@emit</code> 1; <code>@emit</code> 2} from being misparsed and running <code>@emit</code> 2 immediately. Reported by <em>Azratax<code>@Azmush</code></em>. <b>[TAP]</b></li>
 </ul>

<hr>
<h2>Version 1.7.4 patchlevel 14 (January 4, 2002)</h2>

<h3>Minor Changes</h3>

 <ul>
  <li>The global function invocation limit is now 5 times the per-evaluation function invocation limit, to provide some flexibility in cases where you run a small number of functions that cause a larger number of other functions to be evaluated (e.g., using <code>tel()</code> to move players into rooms with function-laden descriptions). <b>[TAP]</b></li>
 </ul>

<h3>Fixes</h3>

 <ul>
  <li>Mortals are now restricted in which html tags they can generate when pueblo support is enabled. Suggested by <em>BladedThoth</em>.</li>
  <li><code>@sitelock/name</code> !&lt;name&gt; was improperly case-sensitive in its matching. Reported by <em>Linda Antonsson</em>.</li>
  <li>Better invocation count checking and aborting on reaching limit. Reported by <em>Ashen-Shugar</em>. <b>[TAP]</b></li>
  <li>Beep characters are ignored when matching object listen patterns. Suggested by <em>Wayne<code>@PDX</code></em>.</li>
  <li>The end-of-dump marker is checked when reading the chat database. Suggested by <em>Bellemore<code>@M</code>*U*S*H</em>. <b>[SW]</b></li>
  <li><code>@lock</code> obj=attrib:value locks were broken. Reported by <em>Linda Antonsson</em>.</li>
  <li>Minor help fixes.</li>
 </ul>

<hr>
<h2>Version 1.7.4 patchlevel 13 (November 30, 2001)</h2>

<h3>Minor changes</h3>

 <ul>
  <li>options.h.dist mentions Darwin as well as MacOS X. <b>[DW]</b></li>
  <li>PCRE updated to 3.7. <b>[SW]</b></li>
  <li>When CHAN_NAME_LEN is increased beyond 30, the <code>@chan/list</code> header line is misaligned, and other strange things can happen to <code>@chan/list</code>. Reported by <em>Bladed Thoth</em></li>
 </ul>

<h3>Fixes</h3>

 <ul>
  <li>Crash bug in chat channels reported by BladedThoth.</li>
 </ul>

<hr>
<h2>Version 1.7.4 patchlevel 12 (November 9, 2001)</h2>

<h3>Minor changes</h3>

 <ul>
  <li><code>@dol/delim</code> is now <code>@dol/delimit</code>, for Mux compatibility. <b>[SW]</b></li>
  <li>/preserve switch for <code>@chownall</code> works like <code>@chown</code>&#39;s /preserve switch. This changes the default behavior of <code>@chownall</code>, which used to preserve everything, to work like <code>@chown</code> and strip privileged bits. Suggested by <em>Taladan<code>@M</code>*U*S*H</em>.</li>
 </ul>

<h3>Fixes</h3>

 <ul>
  <li>Warnings in index-files.pl are no longer shown. Report by Noltar<code>@Korongil</code></li>
  <li>Additional support for ansi in channel names. Ansi is now stripped when sorting channels and when matching names for <code>@chan/decomp</code> and <code>@chan/what</code>.  Reported by <em>Oriens<code>@Alexandria</code></em>.</li>
  <li>Help <code>@decompile</code> clarifies the /flags switch. Suggested by <em>Oriens<code>@Alexandria</code></em></li>
  <li>Source is indented before diffs are produced.</li>
  <li>Typo in help zmr correct by Oriens<code>@Alexandria</code>.</li>
  <li>Players disconnecting without QUIT continued to use CPU until fully disconnected. Fixed. Report by Protagonist<code>@M</code>*U*S*H. <b>[SW]</b></li>
 </ul>

<hr>
<h2>Version 1.7.4 patchlevel 11 (October 15, 2001)</h2>

<h3>Minor Changes</h3>

 <ul>
  <li>In places like <code>switch()</code> that can match &lt;number, the numbers are now treated as floating point, so they need not be only integers. However, they must be pure numbers; &quot;&lt;3km&quot; will not work.</li>
  <li>Tests for channel name matches now disregard ansi. Suggested by <em>Wayne<code>@PDX</code></em>.</li>
 </ul>

<h3>Fixes</h3>

  <li>Help math functions clarifies &#39;number&#39;. Suggested by <em>Delina<code>@ST</code>:VAAE</em></li>
  <li>Information on the patches.h header added to the FAQ file. Suggested  by Kahmy. <b>[SW]</b></li>
  <li>Potential crash in <code>@set</code> fixed. Report by Michael Loftis <b>[SW]</b></li>
  <li>The Unfindable flag is checked on all levels of containers, not just the immediate location. Suggested by <em>Oriens</em>. <b>[SW]</b></li>
  <li>NT_TCP fix by Bellemore.</li>
  <li><code>secure()</code> now escapes ^, as the help says it does. Report by Gabriel Matlin.</li>

  <li><code>@clone</code> can optionally specify a new name for the clone. Patch by Bellemore<code>@M</code>*U*S*H, inspired by mux.</li>
  <li><code>die()</code> can take a third argument which, if true, will cause it to return the list of individual die rolls rather than the sum.</li>
  <li>NT_TCP option moved to options.h.dist, and <code>@config/list</code> compile now reports whether it&#39;s on or not. Suggested by <em>Glonk<code>@GlonkMUSH</code></em></li>

<h3>Fixes</h3>

<hr>
<h2>Version 1.7.4 patchlevel 7 (July 02, 2001)</h2>

<h3>Major changes</h3>

 <ul>
  <li>%r can now evaluate to one character or two, based on a new config  option, newline_one_char, which defaults to being yes. This allows %r to be used as a list delimiter. However, this may break softcode which expects strlen(%r) to be 2, but it&#39;s probably smarter to fix the softcode than turn off this option. [sw]</li>
  <li>If a command and a standard attribute have the same name, the command takes precedence. So if you have an <code>@attribute</code> named &quot;PEMIT&quot;, <code>@pemit</code> me=foo will do the command, not set the attribute. <b>[SW]</b></li>
 </ul>

<h3>Minor changes</h3>

 <ul>
  <li>When someone attempts to create too many attributes on an object, the log indicates who and which object. Suggested by <em>Frob<code>@Battlestar</code></em></li>
 </ul>

<h3>    Galactica</h3>

 <ul>
  <li>Buncha tprintfs replaced with notify_formats. <b>[SW]</b> </li>
  <li>New <code>local_connect()</code> and <code>local_disconnect()</code> hooks in local.dst. Suggested by <em>Rince<code>@M</code>*U*S*H</em>.</li>
  <li>lookup_player now deals with player names prefixed with &quot;*&quot;, so a bunch of commands like <code>@newpassword</code> will now treat those arguments. Suggested by <em>Glonk<code>@GlonkMUSH</code></em>.</li>
